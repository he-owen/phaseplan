# PhasePlan

Smart energy management for your home. Monitor your devices, optimize electricity costs with time-of-use rates, and reduce your carbon footprint.

---

## Features

### Optimization Engine
- MILP solver (PuLP/CBC) takes your devices, utility hourly rates, and weekly schedule to find the cheapest way to run everything across 24 hours
- Cycle appliances (washers, dryers, dishwashers) are scheduled in contiguous blocks
- HVAC modeled with pre-cooling/pre-heating before you arrive home
- Non-smart devices constrained to hours you're actually around
- Weekly mode checks all 7 days to find the cheapest day for heavy loads like laundry or EV charging

### AI-Powered Device Setup
- Type a device name (and optionally brand/model) and Gemini 2.5 Flash with Google Search grounding fills in type, wattage, smart capability, and run duration
- Batch-add up to 50 of the same device at once
- Edit energy, run time, and location inline in the data grid

### Bill OCR
- Upload a bill as PDF or image (PNG, JPG, WEBP, HEIC)
- Gemini extracts month, year, amount, kWh, and utility provider
- Review and edit extracted fields before saving

### Utility Rate Integration
- Fetches real rate structures from the OpenEI API by ZIP code
- Computes hourly rates for every day in a month, classifying each hour as peak, mid-peak, or off-peak
- Synthetic delivery cost model fills in gaps for energy-only rates
- Feeds directly into the optimizer

### Dashboard
- Today's usage and carbon saved with 30-day sparklines and trend indicators
- Monthly cost bar chart, daily energy line chart, energy-by-category pie chart
- Today's potential savings and lifetime totals (dollars saved, CO2 reduced, compliance rate)

### Schedule Feedback
- Daily dialog asks if you followed the suggested schedule
- Responses feed into compliance rate and cumulative savings
- 14-day schedule history on the optimization page

### Notifications
- Upcoming device run windows (next 2 hours)
- Peak rate alerts
- Cheapest off-peak hour today
- Bill reminder if nothing logged for the current month

### Google Home Script Generator
- Generates YAML automation scripts from optimization results
- Copy to clipboard for Google Home routines

### Onboarding
- 3-step setup: ZIP code, utility provider/rate plan selection, weekly schedule and thermostat preferences
- Creates your first location and generates rates automatically

### Preferences
- Per-day home/awake hours and thermostat temperatures
- Manage multiple addresses with ZIP codes
- Copy-to-all-days shortcut for the weekly schedule

### Other
- Multi-location support with per-location device filtering across all views
- Auth0 authentication with protected routes and automatic backend user sync
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Landing page with feature overview, how-it-works flow, FAQ, and dashboard preview
